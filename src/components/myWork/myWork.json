The website offers multiple functionalities to improve the user experience. Users can search for jobs based on keywords or job titles. The job listings provide important details such as company name, location, tags, and posting time. When a user selects a job, they can access comprehensive job descriptions and instructions on how to apply.I improved the user interface in the most recent update to resemble the Wuzzuf interface. Users now have the choice to either create an account or log in, enabling them to customize their profiles by adding personal information. Additionally, they have the ability to save job listings for future reference.",
